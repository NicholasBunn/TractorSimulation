# TractorSimulation
Code for my Reconfigurable Control 814 project. This project provides a digital shadow of tractors on farms based off an Erlang simulation such that a farmer is able to query the consumption and location of various tractors across their farms. Further functionality allows for dynamic creation and removal of tractors and farms as the operational environment calls for it.

This is my first project making use of Java and OOP, so I'm still finding my feet a bit. Implemented within Java, JADE was employed to develop this as a multi-agent system, with this project serving as my introduction to this framework too. There was a lot of back and forth trying to figure out the nuances of the JADE framework while also working with Java and OOP for the first time.

Immediate improvements to functionality would be to add a real-time graph to the GUI that displays the efficiency history of each tractor, as well as a farm layout mapping the various tractors as they move on and inbetween farms.
